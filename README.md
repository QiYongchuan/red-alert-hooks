## How it works

This skill uses [Claude Code hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) — shell commands that fire automatically at lifecycle events. On Windows it uses PowerShell's `SoundPlayer`; on macOS `afplay`; on Linux `aplay`/`paplay`.

All hooks use `"async": true` so sounds play in the background without blocking your workflow.

---

## Customize

**Swap a sound** — edit `~/.claude/settings.json` and point any hook to a different `.wav` file path.

**150+ more sounds** available in the source library:

Download any extra file:
```bash
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgmobrien/red-alert-sounds/main/ra_tanya_lets_rock.wav" \
  -o "$HOME/.claude/skills/red-alert-hooks/sounds/ra_tanya_lets_rock.wav"
```

Popular extras:

| File | Line |
|------|------|
| `ra_tanya_lets_rock.wav` | *"Let's rock!"* |
| `ra_shock_burn_baby_burn.wav` | *"Burn baby burn!"* |
| `ra_yes_sir_soviet_infantry_1.wav` | Soviet accent *"Yes sir!"* |
| `ra_mechanic_yee_haw.wav` | *"Yee-haw!"* |
| `td_mission_accomplished.wav` | Tiberian Dawn version |

**Add more hook events:**

```json
"TaskCompleted":  [ ... ],  // todo task checked off
"SubagentStop":   [ ... ],  // background agent done
"SessionEnd":     [ ... ],  // session closes
"PostCompact":    [ ... ]   // after context compaction
```

**Too noisy?** Remove the `Bash` matcher from `PostToolUse` in `~/.claude/settings.json` to stop the per-command sounds.
